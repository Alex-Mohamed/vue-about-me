# Alex's About Me Website (with Vue)
This website shows users facts about myself, namely regarding my journey into computer science, along with a picture and links to some of my social media accounts where my work is available.

# About Me Website Technology
This website primarily utilizes the Vue framework for website design. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also present in the source code for the website. Throughout the source code, various HTML tags and Vue components are used to bring the website together. CSS can be found in the style tags at the bottom of each Vue file to style text fields. JavaScript functions are used to make the website more interactive, evident by a button that reveals links to my high school research websites and another button that will randomly change the picture on screen (the latter of which is a work in progress).

# Using the About Me Website
This project is a single-page web application, so users interact with the website by reading the text present and using the buttons programmed with JavaScript. A form section is also present at the bottom of the screen where users can decide which aspect of the webpage most needs to be improved in the future.
